# Raw Reasoning Process Comparison

## Prompt
What impact would increasing interest rates have on the tech startup ecosystem?

## Beam Search Thoughts
1. "First, need to consider immediate financial effects on existing startups with loans and credit lines"
2. "This would lead to higher borrowing costs affecting both operational expenses and growth plans"
3. "Venture capital firms would likely become more selective with investments due to higher cost of capital"
4. "This could lead to a focus shift towards profitability over growth, changing startup strategies"
5. "Ultimately, this could lead to a more sustainable but slower-growing tech ecosystem"

### Notes:
Beam Search has a very linear approach to a problem and is great for specific goals you have in mind, or for solving problems you either a.) know the answer to or b.) don't know the answer but understand the direction the model needs to go in order to get the answer right.

My recommendation: 
> This path is good for fairly simple problems; what I'd consider LOW REASONING, meaning the model is not thinking outside the box per se. Perfect for high school to early college mathematics or similar.

## MCTS Thoughts
1. "Initial impact would be tighter capital markets affecting both debt and equity financing"
2. "This could create opportunities for established tech companies to acquire struggling startups"
3. "Remote work trends might accelerate as startups seek to reduce operational costs"
4. "Innovation might shift towards capital-efficient technologies and business models"
5. "Long-term result could be a more resilient but consolidated tech sector with fewer but stronger players"

### Notes:
MCTS shows its strength in exploring multiple possible futures and scenarios. Unlike beam search, it's not constrained to a single line of thought. Each thought represents a different branch of possibility that got the highest visit count during simulation.

My recommendation: 
> Perfect for MEDIUM REASONING tasks where you need to explore multiple possibilities or where the outcome isn't clear cut. Great for strategic analysis, game-like scenarios, or problems with multiple valid solutions. The exploration vs exploitation tradeoff in MCTS makes it particularly good at finding non-obvious connections.

## MCTS Alpha Thoughts
1. "Rising rates would first impact high-growth tech companies with significant cash burn"
2. "This could trigger a wave of pivots toward enterprise and B2B models with more predictable revenue"
3. "Market could see increased focus on AI and automation tools that improve operational efficiency"
4. "Regional tech hubs might emerge in lower-cost areas as companies optimize spending"
5. "Long-term outcome suggests a more distributed, efficient, and financially disciplined tech ecosystem"

### Notes:
MCTS Alpha (using A* with ORM) shows much more sophisticated pattern recognition and outcome-based thinking. The adaptive exploration allows it to focus more heavily on promising paths while still maintaining some level of exploration. The ORM component helps it think through logical consequences of each step.

My recommendation: While this is a far more sophisticated model, it is still in alpha stage and would not *rely* on it for complex, actionable problems. Please know that feedback is always appreciated and the goal is to add this to the default MCTS method if all goes well.

## Implementation Details
- Beam Search: Simple linear progression, keeping only top N paths
- MCTS: Standard Monte Carlo Tree Search with UCT
- MCTS Alpha: A* implementation with:
  - Outcome-based Reward Method (ORM) for consequence simulation
  - Adaptive exploration rate
  - No Process Reward Method (PRM) yet
  - Policy-guided search for better path selection
