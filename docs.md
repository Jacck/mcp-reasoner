# MCP Reasoner Documentation

## Overview

The MCP Reasoner is a sophisticated reasoning engine that implements multiple strategies for exploring and evaluating thought processes. It's designed to provide structured, methodical approaches to complex reasoning tasks across various domains including scientific research, engineering problems, medical analysis, and economic forecasting.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Reasoner**
   - Central orchestrator that manages reasoning strategies and state
   - Handles strategy switching and configuration
   - Provides interfaces for thought processing and statistics

2. **State Manager**
   - Manages the thought tree structure
   - Handles caching and persistence of thought nodes
   - Provides path tracking and retrieval

3. **Strategy Factory**
   - Creates and configures reasoning strategy instances
   - Supports multiple strategy implementations
   - Enables easy addition of new strategies

### Thought Processing Pipeline

1. Input processing and validation
2. Strategy selection and configuration
3. Thought evaluation and scoring
4. Path exploration and optimization
5. Statistics gathering and reporting

## Reasoning Strategies

### 1. Beam Search
- **Description**: Linear progression keeping top N paths
- **Best For**: 
  - Clear, sequential reasoning tasks
  - Problems with well-defined progression
  - Basic cause-effect analysis
- **Configuration**:
  - Configurable beam width (1-10)
  - Default: 3

### 2. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
- **Description**: Standard MCTS implementation with UCT
- **Best For**:
  - Complex problem spaces
  - Multiple valid solution paths
  - Parallel possibility exploration
- **Configuration**:
  - Configurable simulation count (1-150)
  - Default: 50 simulations

### 3. MCTS Alpha (Experimental)
- **Description**: Enhanced MCTS with A* implementation
- **Features**:
  - Outcome-based Reward Method (ORM)
  - Adaptive exploration rate
  - Policy-guided search
- **Best For**:
  - Advanced technical analysis
  - Long-term consequence evaluation
  - Strategic decision-making

## Evaluation Metrics

### Thought Evaluation
- Logical score based on:
  - Length and complexity
  - Logical connectors
  - Mathematical/logical expressions
  - Parent-child coherence
- Depth penalty
- Completion bonus

### Strategy Metrics
- Total nodes explored
- Average score
- Maximum depth
- Branching factor
- Strategy-specific metrics

## Usage

### Basic Implementation

```typescript
const reasoner = new Reasoner();

const response = await reasoner.processThought({
  thought: "Initial thought...",
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 5,
  nextThoughtNeeded: true
});
```

### Strategy Configuration

```typescript
// Configure Beam Search
reasoner.setStrategy(ReasoningStrategy.BEAM_SEARCH, 5);

// Configure MCTS
reasoner.setStrategy(ReasoningStrategy.MCTS, undefined, 100);
```

### Statistics Retrieval

```typescript
const stats = await reasoner.getStats();
const bestPath = await reasoner.getBestPath();
```
